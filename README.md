# Sentiment Classifier

Sentiment classifier using Python, that detects how positive or negative each tweet is. After sentiment has been scored, a CSV is created, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet.
